## How to use

Get the Setup.exe from releases and install it.

Inside the app, you can then enter your email and password to connect.

Currently, only the Props / Friends and Share parts are done.

While into the Props / Friends tab, you can use the Refresh button to show your props / friends.

In the Props tab, you can also press save to save to disk your currently selected props
(so that you can have a "cool props share list" that loads everytime you open the app).

You select props in the Props tab, then select the friends you want to share the props with in the Friends tab.

Finally, you go into the Share tab and click "Yes" to share them all.

If a request fails, it should show you it did (needs further testing), you can click it to retry it some more.
